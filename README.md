This app has two games which have been made on MIT App Inventor. The first is called Colour Shot and the second one is Apple Catcher. If you keep playing the game more than the set amount of time, then you are taken to the exercise page and you can not resume the game until you cover your goal of steps. In the game Colour Shot you have to tilt your phone to get the ball to the right colour. In the game Apple Catcher you need to slide the basket to catch the falling apples. The speed of the falling apples keeps increasing.
